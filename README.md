# Book-Recommendation-System
Developing a personalized book recommender using machine learning

Main objective of this project is focused on developing a recommender system that uses user ratings and preferences to deliver personalized book recommendations. The process includes an initial exploratory analysis to understand user and book data, followed by the application of collaborative filtering, content-based recommendation system and deep learning techniques to predict user preferences. The models' effectiveness will be  evaluated and improved through regularization techniques.
